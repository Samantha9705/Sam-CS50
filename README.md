#### Description:

This application was developed on an iPad using the Swift Playground app.

The reason it was developed using this method was to experiment with new ways of coding and also to explore a new programming language.

During the CS50 course, we learned different languages, and since Swift was new to me, I decided to develop a simple, functional app that didn't require any additional support documents or references.

Swift is a programming language created by Apple, designed to provide programming freedom to developers.

It's also important to mention that the code is open-source, making it adaptable to various projects.

One of the important features of Swift is its focus on functional programming, and it's considered a type-safe language as it checks variables during code compilation, resulting in error detection and correction during the development process.

The Drawing App was developed with the help of the manuals and documentation provided by Swift, and since it's somewhat similar to Python in some aspects, it was easier but no less challenging.

To begin with, this application has two important structures: Lines and Points.

These structures are crucial because, when drawing, several lines of different sizes and colors are created.

This means that each line is a set of points, and each point is a coordinate.

Additionally, some variables were created to establish the color palette to be used when drawing and its appearance.

Similarly, with the lines, a variable was determined to control thickness, and the canvas where all of the above would take place.

Finally, as we can see, the visual design of the application is not the most attractive, but a functional application was successfully created with a new language and programming tool, which was the real challenge and, of course, an achievement.
